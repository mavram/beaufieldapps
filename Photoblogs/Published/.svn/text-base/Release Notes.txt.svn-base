Enjoy Great Photography, Distraction-Free.

PhotoBlogs Reader is a visual RSS reader that curates blogs and preserves the photographs for a comfortable and elegant viewing experience. It integrates and synchronizes with Google Reader to cache on your iPhone/iPod or iPad the photographs for later offline viewing. By stripping away the original layout elements from feed entries it optimizes all the photographs for display on your iPhone/iPod or iPad touch's screen. An app that gets out of the way so you can focus on photography.
